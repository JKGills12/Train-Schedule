# Train-Schedule

This goal of this asssignment was to use Firebase to store user input data and to also use moment.js to convert time. The objective was to show when the next train arrival would be and how many minutes it is away, as well as the frequency of the next train arriving.

## Instructions
The user will input a name of a train, the destination, train time, and the frequency in the 'Add Train' table. Once submitted moment.js will be launched to convert the time of the next arrival and how many minutes away it is. Firebase will then store the data in its database.
