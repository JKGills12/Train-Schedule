# Train-Schedule

This web app was used Firebase to store user input data and to also use moment.js to convert time. The objective was to show when the next train arrival would be and how many minutes it was away, as well as the frequency of the next train arriving.

## Instructions
The user will input a name of a train, the destination, train time, and the frequency in the 'Add Train' table. Once submitted moment.js will be launched to convert the time of the next arrival and how many minutes away it is. Firebase will then store the data in its database.

## Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.


## Setup

We'll leave that up to you -- however you like. Just make sure you're using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GitHub Pages to host your finished site.


## Instructions


Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:


When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:


Train Name


Destination


First Train Time -- in military time


Frequency -- in minutes




Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.


Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.


Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
